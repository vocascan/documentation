## Guidelines

Here is everything you need to know while translating.

- Pay attention to the punctuation so that it is the same as in the English translation.

  `you solved {{percentage}}% of the vocabulary correctly!` should have the placeholder `{{percentage}}`, the `%`- sign
  and the `!` at the end.

- Address the user directly. (In German, the "du" form)

  `You can create vocab cards while deciding which package and group they belong to.` uses the "you" - form. And in
  German the "du" - form.
  `Du kannst Vokabeln erstellen, während Du entscheidest zu welchem Paket und welcher Gruppe sie gehören sollen.`

- Use the same wording for buttons and modals.

  Use `Are you sure you want to delete the package {{name}}?` and not `Do you want to delete the package {{name}}?`
