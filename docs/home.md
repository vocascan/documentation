# Welcome to Vocascan

> Digitalization is creating a huge change in the world. We no longer only have the chance to communicate with our
> fellow human beings in the vicinity, but to interact quickly and easily around the entire globe. Language is our most
> important medium, which helps us to interact with the other person. A common language helps to make life easier and to
> break barriers. That's why we founded Vocascan, a server-client based open-source vocabulary trainer. We believe that
> everyone should have the chance to learn another language for free and in their own way. Based on the ever-proven
> principle of flashcards, we have developed a highly configurable trainer that has many settings to adapt it to your
> learning methods and strategies.

## Core Features

- 📚 **Learn your vocabs** very easily
- ☁️ **Synchronized** with any device
- 👪 **Share** vocabs with your friends

## Getting Started

To use the great variety of Vocascan you need to set up a server. This is necessary because of the structure of the
whole project. Vocascan is client-server based, which has the advantage that you have a central place where all
operations come together. This simplifies synchronization between all your devices and makes everyday use much easier.

To set up your own server without any problems we provide you with extra predefined configurations and instructions. For
a detailed overview of all the installation options, please visit our
[server installation guide](vocascan-server/installation/installation). There you will also find the advantages and
disadvantages as well as the use cases of the different options.

As soon as you have a running server, you can start learning. You just need to download the right client for your
operating system. Again, we have put a lot of emphasis on making it as platform-independent as possible. To find and
download the right client for your operating system, take a look at our
[desktop installation guide](vocascan-desktop/installation).

?> We are currently working on a major architecture restructuring in order to be able to use Vocascan in the browser
very soon.

If any questions have come up, it's best to check out our [FAQ](general/faq). If they are still not answered, feel free
to contact a maintainer. Check the [contact](#contact) section for more information.
