# Welcome to Vocascan

> Digitalization is creating a huge change in the world. We no longer only have the chance to communicate with our fellow human beings in the vicinity, but to interact quickly and easily around the entire globe. Language is our most important medium, which helps us to interact with the other person. A common language helps to make life easier and to break barriers. That's why we founded Vocascan, a server-client based open-source vocabulary trainer. We believe that everyone should have the chance to learn another language for free and in their own way. Based on the ever-proven principle of flashcards, we have developed a highly configurable trainer that has many settings to adapt it to your learning methods and strategies.
