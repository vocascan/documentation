# Quick Start

Quick start guide for vocascan.

Vocascan is a server-client based vocabulary trainer. Due to data protection reasons (DSGVO), we can't provide an official server, which means that you have to host your own (or at least run it locally) unfortunatelly.
But setting up is very easy with our [guide](vocascan-server/installation).

After that, you will definitely want to try the vocabulary trainer. All you have to do is follow the [installation guide](vocascan-desktop/installation).
