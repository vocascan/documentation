# FAQ

## First Questions

### Why do I really need a server?

You require a server because of the design of vocascan. This way you can keep your vocabularies on the same level across
all your devices. It is planned for later that the desktop app will have an integrated server and no external server
will be needed.

### Why is there no official server yet?

Due to data protection reasons (GDPR), there is currently no official vocascan-server hosted.
